                by technology, I&apos;ve spent a lot of time helping friends and family with their
                computers and other tech-related issues. I&apos;ve developed a strong foundation in
                troubleshooting and problem-solving, and I&apos;m excited to bring these skills to a
                professional setting. While I may not have formal experience in the industry yet, my
                passion for technology and eagerness to learn make me a dedicated and enthusiastic
                team member.
